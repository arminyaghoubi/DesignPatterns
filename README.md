# Design Patterns Showcase Project

🌟 **Welcome to the Design Patterns Showcase repository!** This project demonstrates various design patterns implemented within a C# application.

## Project Overview

This repository showcases a range of design patterns applied within a C# application. We've introduced an exemplary implementation of the Chain of Responsibility design pattern and continue to expand with more patterns to illustrate diverse use cases and scenarios.

## Implemented Design Patterns

### Chain of Responsibility

- **Description:** The Chain of Responsibility pattern facilitates passing a request through a series of handlers. Each handler decides whether to process the request or delegate it further along the chain.
- **Use Cases:** Beneficial in scenarios with a sequence of objects capable of handling a request, allowing the system to automatically identify the appropriate handler.

### Command

- **Description:** The Command pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby enabling parameterizing clients with queues, requests, and operations. It allows decoupling sender and receiver, supporting operations like undo/redo, logging, queuing, etc.
- **Use Cases:** Ideal for implementing operations as objects, supporting operations history, queuing, and undo/redo functionalities.

### Upcoming Patterns

🚀 **Stay tuned for updates!** Our roadmap includes various design patterns like Singleton, Factory Method, Observer, and more. Each pattern will be accompanied by a concise description and its specific applications within the project.
